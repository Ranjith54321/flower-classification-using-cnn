# flower-classification-using-cnn
# identifying the 5 types of flowers using cnn
This is my end semester project 

In this project I used Convolution Neural Network model.

source for the data set -> kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition

the given dataset is only splited based on the types and all are image formate 

preparing dataset for training;

1.) split the data in to train test validation 60--20--20
2)  split all of the train test validation folders contains 5 types of flowers 
train -60
test-20
validation -20
